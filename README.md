# CyPort: A Unified Dataset for Port Disruption Analysis under Tropical Cyclones

[![GEE App](https://img.shields.io/badge/GEE-App-green)](https://CyPort-dataset.users.earthengine.app/view/cyport)

**CyPort** is a comprehensive, multimodal dataset designed to support the analysis of portâ€“cyclone interactions and freight network resilience. It integrates port operations, vessel trajectories, tropical cyclone exposures, meteorological conditions, and network-based disruption assessments.

## ðŸ“¦ Dataset Overview

CyPort includes two core components:

1. **Baseline Port and Freight Data (2015â€“2023)**  
   - Daily vessel counts at principal U.S. ports  
   - 745,704 commercial vessel OD trajectories  
   - Port-level trade attributes and infrastructure indicators

2. **Portâ€“Cyclone Interaction Records (1,927 total)**  
   - Exposure conditions (cyclone intensity, distance, duration)  
   - Observed weather and tide data  
   - Port-specific disruption responses  
   - Resilience and network centrality metrics
